# Apache Fineract CN MariaDB

## Abstract
Apache Fineract CN is an application framework for digital financial services, a system to support nationwide and cross-national financial transactions and help to level and speed the creation of an inclusive, interconnected digital economy for every nation in the world.

## Prerequisites
### Runtime
Install Java 8 as described at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html.

### Installation
Install MariaDB as described at https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/binary-packages/.

After installation you need to create the meta database:

    mysql -u root -pmysql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS system_console;
    
## Multi-tenancy
Multi-tenancy is reached by providing separate data storage on a per tenant basis.

For every tenant a new database instance is created internally. A tenant aware component provides transparent access to these resources.
